The project was built as a part of the Microsoft Engage '21 Program. Contributors were required to build a clone of the Teams app with the mandatory feature of connecting via video call and incorporate Agile Methodology into our work. Within a span of 4 weeks the participants were also given a adopt phase of incorporating a chat feature. <br />

<b>Solved Problem:</b> This clone application aims to offer a quick and easy way to connect with your friends, family and teammates by utilising the power of javascript and WebRTC.

<b>Learnings:</b> Through the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021,I was able to learn to about new Technologies, get the habit of working using Agile Methodology and deploy a Full stack webapp.

# Tech Stack Selection

* <b> FRONTEND </b> <br>
I have used **HTML**, **CSS** and **EJS**. I have used Figma to Design the UI. I tried to make sure that the UI of the app was different from Basic Teams to make sure that **MILO** is unique.

* <b> BACKEND </b> <br>
I have used **NODE JS** and **EXPRESS SERVER**

* <b> VIDEO CALL SDK </b> <br>
I research between various SDKs and finally arived at the decision to use **Web RTC**. <br>
I have used **SOCKET IO** for real time Communication and **PEER JS** for peer to peer connection in video call.

* <b> HOSTING PLATFORM </b> <br>
I have used **HEROKU** as the hosting platform.

# Usage of Agile Methodology

Through the 4 week span of the project, I undertook weekly sprints and made sure that small features get implemented in an efficient and time bound manner. Having a usable version of the product from the very beginning and seeing it evolve through the days and weeks was a joyful experience.<br>
